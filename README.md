## 🎯 Goal of this project

At its core, this project embodies two important aims:

1. **Start Your Open Source Journey**: It's aimed to kickstart your open-source journey. Here, you'll learn the basics of Git and get a solid grip on the Machine Learning and I strongly believe that learning and building should go hand in hand.
2. **Python Mastery**: Once you've got the basics down, a whole new adventure begins of mastering Python. This project covers everything, from simple Python Code to advanced performance enhancements. And I've planned much more cool stuff to add in the near future if the project hits more number of contributors.

_I'd love for you to make the most of this project - it's all about learning, helping, and growing in the open-source world._
